# Web3_FinalProject_LaravelBookstore
This is the Final Project for Web 3. In this, I took the bookstore code that I worked on in previous Web classes and modified it over the course of the semester to use in a Laravel Herd project. It includes not only functions available in past versions, but also includes new functions not implemented in past versions of the project.
